# FinalProjectJCDS
Predicting the success and failure of campaigns on Kickstarter

dataset:  https://www.kaggle.com/kemical/kickstarter-projects


this project is made as my Final Project on Purwadhika's Data Science and Machine Learning Job Connector Program
there are several limitations on this project
1. this could only predict the success and failure of the campaign. success on the campaign does not mean the campaigner will actually deliver the product
2. this is a two-week project, so this project is still in it's experimental stage



on this project, I will be using Logistic Regression because it turned out to be the one that returns the lowest false positive rate.
